# Trading Stratedy Program written in Python


This program signals when to buy or sell stocks using the Dual Moving Average Crossover (DMAC) strategy.  

DMAC crossover points define points of decision to buy or sell the currencies/stocks. 

A signal to buy stocks is triggered when the short term average crosses the long term average and rises above the long term average. 

Similarly, a signal to sell stocks is triggered when short term average crosses the long term average and drops below the long term average mark.
